    "+ You need to register yourself as a developer on Facebook\n",
    "+ You create an App on your Facebook developer page\n",
    "+ You go to Graph Explorer to generate an Access Token with the permissions you want (I recommend getting all of them for this purpose to avoid errors later)\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "You will absolutely need to introduce the ACCESS_TOKEN but APP_ID and APP_ID_SECRET are only required in order to extend your ACCESS_TOKEN. If you are fine working with a short lived ACCESS_TOKEN and renewing that ACCESS_TOKEN manually on your Facebook developers page, then you can leave APP_ID and APP_ID_SECRET empty\n",
    "\n",
    "PAGE_ID: The ID of the Public page you will scrape (for instance: '1889414787955466'). You will usually see this on the URL on your browser. Sometimes, however, a name is provided. The name WILL NOT work, you need to figure out the ID. (There are plenty of websites that do this, I use https://www.wallflux.com/facebook_id/)"
