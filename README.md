# facebook-scraper
A set of python modules to help scrape data from Facebook using the Graph API and store it in different formats

## Requirements
This project has been developed on OSX using Python's Anaconda 4.3.1 (Python 3.6) which comes pre-packaged with all the necessary libraries for running this project. I do not provide support for Windows or Linux, nor to users who are not using the Anaconda distribution.

## Usage
Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for step-by-step illustrations of how it works:
[Scraping Basics](ScrapingBasics.ipynb)

## Limitations
Apart from the non-implemented aspects, this scraper is subjected to the limitations/possibilities provided by the Graph API (i.e. cannot scrape closed groups unless it is the admin doing it or inability to scrape a profile page). Please refer to the Graph API Documentation for an understanding of those limitations
